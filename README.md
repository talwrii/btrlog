- https://github.com/sysnux/btrfs-snapshots-diff.git
- `snapper` provides similar features but requires you to specify versiosn (and use snapper)

Influenced by `git`

# Caveats

- This approachs use `btrfs subvolumes find-new`, there is an alternative approach using `btrfs receive`.
- If you read this code you might object to the shell one-liners it contains. These hep fast development.
